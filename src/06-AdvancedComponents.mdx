# Biotope: Advanced Components

## Prerequisites
- A suitable working component with some kind of state and more than one element in it e.g. an accordion.
- Write testable Code â†’ functional Code / Code without side effects
- Confidence in writing Code

## Subject Areas
1. **Typescript**: Rewrite your components in typescript. Write Interfaces where needed and think about edgecases. Don't care about IE11! Make it as awesome and future proof as possible.
2. **Testing**: Write unit-tests with mocha and chai to make sure your component is still working as expected. You can of course always test yourself.
3. **Data handling**: We start with TDD, write a test and then the actual code
    - Filter array
    - Find in array
    - Sort array
    - Map array
    - Reduce
4. **APIs**: Handle API Calls over HTTP
    - Fetch data from a real API
